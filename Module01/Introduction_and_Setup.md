## ⚙️ What is Advanced Data Analysis?

ChatGPT Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), formerly known as Code Interpreter, is a powerful tool within ChatGPT that allows users to:
- Analyze data using code (Python)
- Generate insights from structured and unstructured data
- Create charts, summaries, and transformations interactively
- Build tools, visualizations, and models using natural language prompts

## 🔧 Enabling Advanced Data Analysis

To enable ADA in ChatGPT:
1. Use ChatGPT Plus or Enterprise.
2. Go to **Settings → Beta features → Enable Advanced Data Analysis**.

## 🧩 Treating ChatGPT ADA as an Intern

This approach encourages:
- Iterative prompting
- Delegating tasks
- Receiving intermediate outputs
- Treating ChatGPT as a tool builder and co-pilot

## 💡 Use Cases

Some problems ADA can solve that standard GPT-4 cannot:
- File uploads and analysis (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Chart generation and data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Image transformations
- Text file parsing and transformations
- Complex calculations and simulations


## 🧠 Prompt Engineering (Foundation)

Prompt engineering is the core method of interacting effectively with ADA. This includes:
- Using structured prompts
- Debugging and refining prompts for accuracy
- Creating reusable prompt patterns for specific workflows


## ✅ Summary

Module 1 sets the foundation by explaining:
- What ADA is and how it works
- How to activate and use it
- Real-world scenarios it can handle
- Basic prompt engineering concepts to communicate effectively with ADA
